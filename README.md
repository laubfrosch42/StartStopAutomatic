# SSA - What it is about?

Do you have an automatic gearshift and a Start-Stop-Automatic in your car?
Are you annoyed when the engine of you car stops when you shortly stop at a crossing to watch left and right?
Or when you shortly stop in a traffic jam although you can move forward every few seconds?

This little device will bring the SSA used for automatic gearshifts to the same functionality used for manual gearshifts (activating SSA when in neutral only).
The device will deactivate the SSA-function a few seconds after ignition. Then it will keep it deactivated until you move the automatic gearshift into neutral position. This is the trigger to activate the SSA. Once moved back to drive (or any other than neutral) the device will deactivate the SSA again. The status is continuously measured by comparing the status of SSA-LED in push-button and Neutral-LED.
By that you have the same control as in a manual gearshift.
